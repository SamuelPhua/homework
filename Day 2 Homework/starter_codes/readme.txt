Instructions
For this exercise you will do the following:

App Component
Examine the working live solution and determine the functionality needed

Examine the HTML provided in src/index.html as this contains the HTML elements needed for the design

Determine how best to organize the data needed to render the images

Create a file called imageData.js that contains the data needed, in this case images

Using Array.map() loop over the data to create the small images based on the structure you decided

Render the array of elements

Import useState into App

Use one or more instances of useState to implement the logic

Work out the remaining logic needed to implement the design

Note: All functionality must be placed within App and no additional Components should be created.

Bonus - Additional State
Add more state and/or update existing state in order to keep track of which small image was clicked
Place a green border around the image to indicate that it is the image being displayed.
Any other previously active image will have it's border colour removed
